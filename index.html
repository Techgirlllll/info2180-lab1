           <h2>Abbigail Parchment </h2>

           <p>I am a University of the West Indies student seeking a bachelor's degree in Computer science in which I plan to specialize in Software Development. I was born and raised in Spanish Town, St. Catherine and I attended St. Jago High School  where I developed the passion for Computer Science.
            Throughout my life I have encountered and conquered many obstacles, this newfangled knowledge of my hidden capabilities engineered a mental toughness and ignited a burning ambition for fearlessly tackling adversity. Absurd, some may say, but the journey moulded me into being resilient, determined and a risk-taker along with acknowledging the passion I have to persevere during times of tribulation which are characteristics of conquering the challenging major- Computer Science. It is a dream of mine to make a difference in someone else's life, whether to contribute to their happiness or to be someone they can emulate; therefore, I chose Computer Science as I believe the world is transitioning to a technological space so creative and tech-savvy minds like mine will be beneficial for the future.
            I am interested in Web development as it is a fast-paced, demanding and it requires critical thinking which will allow me to challenge myself continuously. It will help me to actualize my creativity and most importantly, provide an exciting career in code.
